# ML Final Project (2021)

Authors: James Courson, Jay Pankey, Patrick Spafford

go to svm/Usage.md for explaination on how to use classifier.
train_clf.py is the final implentation of our svm. This will take an image path as input and display an image with a detection windows displayed over the image where the classifier thought a human was.

Preprocessing
- kmeans2.py
- pca.py

OpenCV Person Detector
- detection_baseline.py (baseline OpenCV detector)

Utils
- frame_extractor.py (for IR footage)
- svm.py (just runs it either live or prerecorded footage for open cv)
